# codeowner-gen
I work for a company that likes to PR review everything.

I work for a company that has a staff with an attention to well-formatted, pretty files.

I don't like that CODEOWNERS files, if you have to edit them with a path longer than all previous paths, would require you to re-format the entire CODEOWNERS file, prompting a PR reviewer to have to either click "approve" without considering the content of the file, or actually read the entire CODEOWNERS file again.

This program takes a format that **can** be formatted, yaml, and does a few things:

- You specify a bunch of paths and one or more owners per path, and it will alphabetize it and ensure that all records are spaced so that output is columnar,
- unless you specify one or more of the objects as "grouped", in which case it will alphabetize and then group the records together,
- it processes the Owners you've listed and I might eventually enable the app to validate that the user/team you've specified actually exists,
- You can specify a comment, per line, and it will render it out for you.

## Usage
`codeowner-gen` in a directory with a well-formatted codeowners.yaml will output a CODEOWNERS file.

Given a yaml file like below:
```
---
entries:
  - path: "alpha"
    comment: "Alphabetically speaking, this probably is coming early on"
    group: "phonetic"
    owners:
    - "@petergrace"
  - path: "zebra"
    comment: "This is likely the last entry"
    group: "phonetic"
    owners:
    - "@petergrace"
  - path: "*"
    group: "main"
    owners:
    - "@petergrace"
  - path: "target/debug/deps/itoa-*"
    owners:
    - "pete.grace@gmail.com"
    - "@petergrace"
    - "@petergrace/teamname"
```

The codeowners-gen program will output:
```
